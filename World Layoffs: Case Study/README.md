## Limitations
+ **Incomplete Data**: The dataset for both the years 2020 and 2024 may be incomplete. In 2020, data collection began in March when the COVID-19 pandemic was declared, potentially missing layoffs that occurred earlier in the year. Similarly, for 2024, as the year is not yet over, the dataset may lack complete information, leading to gaps or inaccuracies in the analysis of layoffs for that year.
+ **Limited Context**: The dataset provides information about the company, location, industry, and date of layoffs, but lacks additional context regarding the reasons behind the layoffs, such as economic factors, company performance, or specific events.
+ **Incomplete Company Information**: Detailed information about each company beyond its names, such as size, revenue, or market position, is not available in the dataset. This lack of detail hinders a comprehensive understanding of the layoffs.
+ **Funds Raised**: While funds raised may serve as an indicator of the company's financial health, it may not provide a complete picture. Factors such as profitability, cash flow, and debt levels are also crucial considerations for understanding a company's financial situation.
+ **Limited Historical Data**: The dataset covers a specific timeframe, but does not include historical data on layoffs before that period. This limitation restricts the ability to analyze trends and patterns over time.
